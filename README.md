# A Reduction-Driven Local Search Algorithm For Generalized Independent Set Problem
The software and data in this repository are a snapshot of the software and data that were used in the research reported on in the paper A Reduction-Driven Local Search Algorithm For Generalized Independent Set Problem by Yiping Liu, Yi Zhou, Zhenxiang Xu, Mingyu Xiao and Jin-Kao Hao.

# Description
We study the \textit{generalized independent set} (GIS) problem.
In an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$, where $V$ is the vertex set and $E$ is the edge set, each vertex $v\in V$ is assigned a profit $w(v)\in \mathbb{R}$ and each edge $e\in E$ is either a \textit{permanent edge} or a \textit{removable edge}. 
If $e$ is a removable edge, then it is further associated with a penalty $p(e)\in \mathbb{R}$. 
The GIS problem asks for a subset $I\subseteq V$ that contains no permanent edges with both endpoints in $I$, and maximizes the difference between the sum of vertex profits in $I$ and the sum of penalties of removable edges with both endpoints in $I$. An example is shown in the following figure. 
The set of red vertices is a solution with a net benefit of $2-1+6+5=12$.

The GIS problem has a number of applications in modern areas such as forest harvesting, competitive facility location, social network analysis, and even machine learning. However, solving the GIS problem in large-scale real-world networks is still computationally intractable. 
To address the issue, we first propose 14 reduction rules that can reduce the input graph with optimality guarantees.
We then present a reduction-driven local search (RLS) algorithm that integrates these
reduction rules into the pre-processing, the initial solution generation, and the local
search operation phases in a computationally efficient way. We further evaluate RLS with 278 graphs arising from different application scenarios. The performance of RLS
is highly competitive â€“ It finds much better solutions than other known solvers for a majority of graphs, and it delivers high-quality solutions for graphs with more than 10
million vertices, while every known approach fails. Analysis also reveals that the data reduction plays a key role in achieving such a competitive performance.

This project contains two folders: PD, RPD.

PD: This folder contains the data, source codes, makefile and results of the penalty decomposition methods.
RPD: This folder contains the data, source codes, makefile and results of the relaxed penalty decomposition methods.
